👋 **Hi there!** I'm Pavel, and I sometimes write software, but I can do rather a lot of other things with computers as well.

🤔 I'm generally interested in improving the way we learn and organize our private information; and a firm believer that programming is going to be the new literacy, but programming languages won't be a major part of that transition — we're not even remotely at the limit of what [📄 GUIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) can do ([🎬 this guy has explained some of the problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AItTqnTsVjA) really well, but that's just a start).

🔭 I'm not actively working on anything open-source right now; my latest jam is **self-hosting** for most of my personal information (aka "getting off the cloud") and my **smart home** powered by the wonderful [🏠 Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io/) and a whole bunch of diverse hardware.

📫 I keep my up-to-date contact details over on [🌍 my website](https://dside.ru/en/). Feel free to get in touch by any means specified there!
